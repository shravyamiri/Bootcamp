## üìò Section 1: Core Python Proficiency

### 1. Data Structures: Lists, Dicts, Sets, Tuples
- Understand the properties, performance characteristics, and use cases of Python's core data structures.
- Learn efficient manipulation and algorithmic operations with each structure.

### 2. Comprehensions and Generator Expressions
- Write clean, expressive list, dict, and set comprehensions.
- Use generator expressions for memory-efficient handling of large datasets.

### 3. Functions and Arguments
- Master function definitions and diverse argument types (`*args`, `**kwargs`).
- Understand default values, keyword-only arguments, and their impact on function design.

### 4. Scope and Closures
- Learn local, global, and nonlocal scope rules.
- Create closures to encapsulate state and implement functional design patterns.

### 5. Error Handling
- Use `try...except` blocks effectively.
- Raise and define custom exceptions to signal specific application errors.

### 6. Iterators and Generators
- Build custom iterators using `__iter__()` and `__next__()`.
- Create memory-efficient generators with `yield`.

---

## üß† Section 2: Pythonic Idioms

### 1. EAFP vs LBYL
- Learn the difference between "Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission" (EAFP) and "Look Before You Leap" (LBYL).
- Apply the right philosophy for robust and idiomatic Python code.

### 2. Built-in Functions and Idioms
- Leverage `map()`, `filter()`, `zip()`, `enumerate()`, and other core Python tools.
- Follow best practices and patterns to write elegant Python code.

### 3. Inline Expressions and Shortcuts
- Use conditional expressions and other one-liners effectively without sacrificing readability.

### 4. Context Managers and `with`
- Use the `with` statement for resource management (files, DB connections).
- Create custom context managers using `__enter__()` and `__exit__()`.

---

## üß± Section 3: Object-Oriented Design

### 1. Classes and Objects
- Define classes and instantiate objects to model real-world systems.
- Use attributes and methods to encapsulate behavior and data.

### 2. Inheritance and `super()`
- Promote code reuse with inheritance.
- Use `super()` to invoke base class methods cleanly.

### 3. Dunder (Magic) Methods
- Customize object behavior using methods like `__init__`, `__str__`, `__getitem__`, and more.

### 4. Data Classes and Named Tuples
- Use `@dataclass` for clean and boilerplate-free data containers.
- Use `collections.namedtuple` for lightweight, immutable structures.

### 5. Static and Class Methods
- Understand the difference and usage of `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod`.

---

## üßÆ Section 4: Functional Tools

### 1. First-Class Functions and Lambdas
- Treat functions as values‚Äîpass them around as arguments or return them.
- Use lambdas for simple inline operations.

### 2. Decorators
- Write and use decorators to extend behavior.
- Apply decorators for logging, caching, and more.

### 3. `functools` Utilities
- Use `functools.partial`, `wraps`, `lru_cache`, and other tools for cleaner, more powerful functional code.

### 4. `itertools` Essentials
- Master efficient iteration tools like `chain()`, `combinations()`, `groupby()`, and more.

---

## üì¶ Section 5: Standard Library Mastery

### 1. `collections`
- Use `defaultdict`, `Counter`, `deque`, `OrderedDict`, and others for specialized needs.

### 2. Filesystem and Path Handling
- Use `os` and `pathlib` for cross-platform file and directory operations.

### 3. Date and Time
- Manage timestamps and durations using the `datetime` module.

### 4. Serialization: `json`, `csv`, `pickle`
- Serialize/deserialize structured data with JSON, CSV, and Python objects with `pickle`.

### 5. Subprocess and Concurrency
- Execute system-level commands using `subprocess`.
- Handle multi-threading (`threading`) and multiprocessing (`multiprocessing`).

---

## ‚úÖ Section 6: Data Validation and Code Clarity

### 1. Data Classes and Manual Validation
- Add validation logic in data class initializers.

### 2. Validation with `pydantic`
- Enforce type safety and validation rules declaratively.

### 3. Field Metadata and Readability
- Use metadata to enhance field documentation and structure clarity.

### 4. Logging Best Practices
- Use the `logging` module to capture runtime information and diagnose issues.

### 5. Code Clarity and Naming
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines and use descriptive naming conventions for maintainable code.

---

## üöÄ Section 7: Performance and Debugging

### 1. Profiling and Timing
- Analyze performance using `cProfile`, `line_profiler`, and `timeit`.

### 2. Lazy Evaluation and Efficiency
- Use generators and iterators to delay computation and save memory.

### 3. Debugging Tools and Practices
- Master debugging with `pdb` and structured error resolution workflows.

### 4. Design for Observability
- Build systems that are easy to monitor, debug, and maintain.

### 5. Packaging with `pyproject.toml`
- Use `pyproject.toml` for standardized packaging and dependency management.
