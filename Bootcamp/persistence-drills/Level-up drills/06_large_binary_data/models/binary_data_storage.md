Binary Data Storage Reflection
Pros and Cons of Storing Images as BLOBs
Pros:

Simplicity: Storing images in image_blob (as in store_blob.py) keeps data in one place, simplifying backups and migrations.
Atomicity: Database transactions ensure consistent image and metadata updates, reducing data inconsistency risks.
Portability: No external storage dependencies; the database contains everything, easing deployment.
Security: Database access controls protect images, unlike file system permissions.

Cons:

Storage Overhead: Large BLOBs (e.g., images) increase database size, slowing backups, restores, and queries (Challenge 9).
Performance: Retrieving BLOBs is slower than file system reads, impacting API response times.
Scalability: Databases are not optimized for large binary data, straining memory and I/O.
Cost: Database storage is often more expensive than file storage (e.g., S3).

Pros and Cons of Storing File Paths
Pros:

Performance: Storing paths in image_path (as in store_file.py) and files on disk is faster for reads, ideal for serving images via APIs.
Scalability: File systems or cloud storage (e.g., S3) handle large datasets better than databases.
Cost: File storage is cheaper, especially with cloud providers.
Flexibility: Easier to process images (e.g., resizing) on disk or via CDN.

Cons:

Complexity: Managing files requires handling file system permissions, cleanup, and consistency with database records.
Consistency Risks: File and database updates are not atomic, risking orphaned files or missing records (Challenge 5â€™s transactions could help).
Backup Complexity: Separate database and file backups complicate disaster recovery.
Security: File system permissions are harder to manage than database ACLs.

When to Use Each?

BLOBs: Best for small, infrequently accessed binary data (e.g., thumbnails) or when simplicity and atomicity are critical.
File Paths: Preferred for large, frequently accessed images (e.g., profile photos) or when integrating with CDNs for performance.

The solution uses a hybrid user_profiles table to support both approaches, with Pydantic schemas for API consistency.
