Schema Evolution Reflection
What could go wrong if you applied this change directly?
Applying the created_at column addition directly (e.g., via ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL) without a migration tool could lead to:

Data Loss: Without a default value, PostgreSQL will reject the NOT NULL constraint for existing rows, causing the migration to fail or requiring manual data population.
Downtime: The ALTER TABLE operation may lock the table, blocking read/write operations and causing service interruptions, especially for large tables.
Inconsistency: If the operation is interrupted (e.g., server crash), the database could be left in an inconsistent state.
Application Errors: If the application expects created_at but the column is missing or partially applied, it may crash or produce incorrect results.
Rollback Difficulty: Without a downgrade script, reverting the change is error-prone and may require manual SQL.

How do production systems manage zero-downtime migrations?
Production systems use several strategies to achieve zero-downtime migrations:

Backward-Compatible Changes: Add columns with default values (as done here with server_default=sa.func.now()) or allow NULL initially to avoid breaking existing queries.
Staged Rollouts: Deploy application code that handles both old and new schemas first, then apply the migration. For example, the application could ignore created_at until the two database instances, apply migrations to the inactive one, then switch traffic after validation.
Migration Tools: Alembic (used here) ensures versioned, repeatable migrations with downgrade support, as shown in add_created_at_to_users.py.
Monitoring and Testing: Test migrations in a staging environment, monitor lock wait times, and use canary deployments to apply changes incrementally.

This migration uses Alembic and a default value to ensure safety and minimal disruption, supporting zero-downtime deployment.
