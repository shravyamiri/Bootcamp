Versioned Data Storage Reflection
When is it better to version data rather than overwrite it?
Versioning data, as implemented in email_history.py, is preferable to overwriting in the following scenarios:

Auditability: When regulatory or compliance requirements mandate tracking changes (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), versioning preserves a full history for audits, as seen with email changes.
Debugging and Recovery: Versioning allows reverting to previous states or analyzing incorrect updates, useful for debugging issues in update_profile.py (Challenge 2).
User Transparency: Applications requiring visibility into historical data (e.g., account settings changes) benefit from versioning to show users their past emails.
Data Analytics: Historical data enables trend analysis or behavior tracking, such as monitoring email update frequency.
Concurrency Safety: Versioning avoids conflicts in concurrent updates (relevant to Challenge 5), as each change is a new record rather than modifying existing data.

Overwriting is better when:

Storage constraints prioritize efficiency over history (e.g., high-frequency updates with low audit value).
Data changes are trivial or transient (e.g., session tokens).
Simplicity is critical, and historical data has no business value.

The email_history table balances storage overhead with auditability, using a foreign key to users and timestamps to track changes, making it ideal for compliance and debugging.
