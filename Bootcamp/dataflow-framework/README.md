# Abstraction Through Streaming Line Processing

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project chronicles the transformation of a simple line-processing script into a powerful, configurable, and reusable streaming engine. Designed as a progressive series of abstraction levels, it serves as a deep dive into building software that is adaptable, testable, and extensible.

Each level adds new design considerations, challenges, and enhancementsâ€”moving from a basic script to a sophisticated, state-aware, DAG-based, fault-tolerant system. This project is a hands-on guide for anyone looking to master abstraction, modularity, and the architecture of robust stream processing applications.

> The ultimate goal: not just functionality, but **scalable design thinking**.

## ðŸ§± Project Structure

The project is organized into clearly defined abstraction levels. Each level resides in its own directory, containing code, documentation, and enhancements introduced at that stage:

| Level                 | Description                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `abstraction-level-0` | Basic Script (No Abstraction)               |
| `abstraction-level-1` | CLI Interface and Parameterization          |
| `abstraction-level-2` | Modular Design and Standardized Processing  |
| `abstraction-level-3` | Dynamic, Config-Driven Pipeline             |
| `abstraction-level-4` | Stream Processing with Stateful Logic       |
| `abstraction-level-5` | DAG-Based Routing and Conditional Flows     |
| `abstraction-level-6` | Stateful Routing System                     |
| `abstraction-level-7` | Observability and System Introspection      |
| `abstraction-level-8` | Folder Monitoring, Automation, and Recovery |

Each level is self-contained and builds upon the previous, making it easy to follow and implement incrementally.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will gain hands-on experience in:

*  **Refactoring & Abstraction**: Identifying design pain points and introducing clean, high-level abstractions.
***Modularity & Reusability**: Writing composable modules for flexible reuse.
*  **Configuration Management**: Clean separation of logic and configuration for runtime flexibility.
*  **Pipeline Architecture**: Designing and building extensible data processing pipelines.
*  **Stream Processing**: Understanding and implementing event-driven line-by-line processing.
*  **State Management**: Leveraging internal state for contextual decision-making.
*  **DAG-Based Routing**: Implementing flow control using Directed Acyclic Graph structures.
*  **Dynamic Routing**: Building logic-based routing based on runtime conditions or content.
* **System Observability**: Embedding introspection, logging, and monitoring capabilities.
*  **Robustness & Recovery**: Designing for resilience with fault detection and recovery.
*  **Testability**: Writing testable and maintainable software with clean interfaces.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To begin, navigate to the first level:

```bash
cd abstraction-level-0
```

Each level contains its own README and step-by-step instructions. Follow along sequentially to fully grasp the design principles introduced at each stage.
