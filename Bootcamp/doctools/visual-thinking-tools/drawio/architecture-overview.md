# 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the system architecture, outlining the key components, their responsibilities, and how they interact with each other. A visual representation of the architecture has been created using **Draw.io** to clearly communicate the structure and data flow of the system.

## 📌 Purpose

The goal of this architecture is to:
- Separate concerns between client and server
- Ensure scalable communication between services
- Clearly define the flow of data from the frontend to the database

## 🧱 Key Components

### 1. **Frontend (Client)**
- Built using React (or insert your frontend stack)
- Sends user requests to the backend via API endpoints
- Renders dynamic data based on backend responses

### 2. **Backend (API Server)**
- Handles business logic and data processing
- Exposes RESTful APIs
- Performs authentication and authorization
- Communicates with the database

### 3. **Database**
- Stores application data (e.g., users, transactions)
- Responds to queries from the backend

## 🔄 Data Flow

1. The **user** interacts with the **frontend UI**.
2. The frontend sends a request (e.g., login or data fetch) to the **backend**.
3. The **backend** processes the request and queries the **database** if needed.
4. The **database** sends a response to the backend.
5. The **backend** sends the processed response back to the frontend.
6. The **frontend** updates the UI accordingly.

## 🧩 Technologies Used

| Layer      | Technology         |
|------------|--------------------|
| Frontend   | React / HTML / JS  |
| Backend    | Node.js / Express  |
| Database   | MongoDB / MySQL    |
| Diagram Tool | Draw.io          |

## ✅ Summary

This architecture ensures a modular and maintainable system. Using Draw.io allowed us to clearly visualize the architecture, making it easier for team members and stakeholders to understand the system’s structure and flow.
