# Feature Proposal: Dark Mode Toggle for Web Application

## 1. Problem Statement

Currently, our web application lacks a dark mode option. Many users work in low-light environments and have requested a feature to reduce eye strain during nighttime usage.

## 2. Goals

- Add a "Dark Mode" toggle to the application UI
- Persist theme preference across sessions
- Ensure accessibility and contrast compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## 3. Non-Goals

- Redesign of existing UI components
- Support for user-defined custom themes

## 4. Proposed Solution

Implement a toggle switch in the top-right navigation bar that switches between light and dark themes. This can be achieved by:

- Using CSS variables and a `data-theme` attribute on `<body>`
- Storing user preference in `localStorage`
- Adding a `useEffect` hook (React) to apply the stored theme on load

## 5. Technical Considerations

- Fallback theme should default to light
- Color palette must meet accessibility standards
- Ensure smooth transitions between themes

## 6. Alternatives Considered

- System-level theme detection via `prefers-color-scheme` media query (but it lacks user override)
- Server-side rendering of theme (adds complexity)

## 7. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk                                    | Mitigation                              |
|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Poor color contrast in dark theme       | Use automated contrast testing tools     |
| Theme flicker on load                   | Apply theme class as early as possible   |

## 8. Timeline

- Week 1: Design mockups + theme color palette
- Week 2: Implement toggle and theming logic
- Week 3: QA testing, accessibility check, and deployment

## 9. Review Comments Summary

- ✅ Peer 1 suggested using `prefers-color-scheme` as a fallback
- ✅ Peer 2 recommended testing with screen readers
- ✅ All comments resolved before finalizing
