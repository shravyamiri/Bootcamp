Coral reefs can be viewed as microbially driven ecosystems that rely on the efficient capture, retention, and recycling of nutrients in order to thrive in oligotrophic waters. Microorganisms play vital roles in maintaining holobiont health and ecosystem resilience under environmental stress; however, they are also key players in positive feedback loops that intensify coral reef decline, with cascading effects on biogeochemical cycles and marine food webs. There is an urgent need to develop a fundamental understanding of the complex microbial interactions within coral reefs and their role in ecosystem acclimatization, and it is important to include microorganisms in reef conservation in order to secure a future for these unique environments.",

These ecosystems are one of the most diverse and productive environments on the planet, offering shelter, food, and habitat for at least 25% of known marine species and providing important economic services, including coastal protection, tourism, and fisheries (Figure\u00a01). Despite their global importance, coral reefs have suffered unprecedented losses in the recent past and are critically threatened by the continued increase in sea surface water temperature and ocean acidification resulting from climate change. The first mass coral bleaching event was recorded in 1988, and over the past 4 years alone, prominent coral reef ecosystems like the Great Barrier Reef have lost as much as 50% of shallow-water corals. A thorough understanding of the mechanisms involved in coral bleaching and resilience is needed, in combination with immediate global action to reduce carbon emissions in order to avoid further coral reef decline.",

Benthic organisms, such as scleractinian (stony) corals, i.e. the foundation species of coral reefs (see Box 1 for full definition of this term and others used in this review article), and sponges, form close associations with a wide diversity of eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and viruses, collectively termed the holobiont. The importance of endosymbiotic dinoflagellates in providing nutrients and energy to animal hosts such as corals has been well established. However, there is increasing support for the fundamental role of prokaryotic members of the holobiont in maintaining host fitness, with functions ranging from nutrient supply and recycling to protection against invading pathogens. Climate change conditions can trigger a destabilization of the natural microbiome, leading to a state of dysbiosis with the emergence of opportunistic and potentially pathogenic taxa and resulting in a rising incidence of disease, bleaching, and ultimately host mortality. It has therefore been postulated that the microbiome could play a central role in coral reef restoration and that microbial community changes in response to disturbances could act as early warning signals since these shifts may precede visual signs of bleaching and tissue necrosis.",

An example is the shift from coral- to algae-dominated states, which has been observed on reefs worldwide following mass coral bleaching and/or disease. This transition is accelerated and intensified through a microbially driven positive feedback loop that leads to increased coral mortality and microbialization of the ecosystem. A holistic microbial ecosystem approach is therefore needed to accurately evaluate and predict the impacts of future climate conditions on coral reefs, integrating across scales from individual microbes and holobiont functioning to ecosystem-wide food webs and biogeochemical processes.",

By discussing microbially driven effects on holobiont health in relation to the broader ecosystem and food webs through benthic-pelagic coupling and ecosystem phase shifts, we strive to provide a holistic view of microbial interactions in coral reef environments. Finally, we assess the use of microorganisms as biomarkers of ecosystem health and their potential application in marine conservation and reef restoration practices. Given the critical role of microorganisms in driving global climate change, we advocate that microbes become an integral component of climate change research and decision-making in conservation and natural resource management.",

This symbiotic consortium is termed the coral holobiont and acts as an integrated unit to maintain organismal function under constant environmental pressure. Coral-associated microorganisms frequently form intimate species-specific relationships with their host, but they can also vary across different temporal and spatial scales, the latter ranging from biogeographical regions to the many microbial niches of a coral colony. Although most contemporary coral microbiome research has analyzed composite coral samples, it is important to distinguish between the different microhabitats, including the coral mucus, tissues, skeleton, and gastric cavity. Within each of these habitats, microorganisms can reside as transient communities or established symbionts with positive, neutral, or negative interactions. The surface mucous layer (SML) is the interface between the surrounding seawater and the coral epithelium and plays an essential role in coral reef nutrient cycling, heterotrophic feeding, sediment removal, pathogen defense, and protection against stress. The microbial community within this layer is expected to be dynamic because of the highly variable environment and more loosely associated with the host owing to continuous shedding and replenishing of the SML. Coral-associated microbial aggregates (CAMAs) on the\u00a0other hand are prevalent and abundant within coral tissues (epidermal and gastrodermal epithelia). They are often co-localized with Symbiodiniaceae and are likely integrated into shared metabolic pathways central to maintaining coral fitness. Finally, the coral skeleton is highly environmentally stable yet harbors a vastly diverse endolithic community, comprising bacteria, fungi, and filamentous algae, and is structured down to\u00a0millimeter scales. Several attempts have been made to identify\u00a0a core coral microbiome in order to establish a baseline from which to decipher key determinants of holobiont well-being and functioning under future environmental change. This has, for example, led to an alleged classification of the microbiome into three components: an environmentally responsive community (mostly transient), a resident microbiome (species specific), and a small conserved core microbiome (possibly symbiotic). Putative beneficial microorganisms for corals have also been established that may be used to improve coral health. As a level of functional redundancy has been suggested among members of the coral holobiont, it may, however, be more insightful to define a core functionome consisting of metabolic traits that are essential to establishing a symbiotic relationship and maintaining holobiont fitness.",

Moreover, DMSP can function as an osmolyte or cryoprotectant, whereas DMS can act as a scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via conversion to dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). A recent study showed the presence of DMSO reductase genes associated with Endozoicomonas, a likely constituent of the coral core microbiome (Box 2), highlighting a potential role in the regeneration of this antioxidant. As various microorganisms can show chemotaxis toward DMSP, it may also be involved in the acquisition of symbionts, such as Rhizobiales and Roseobacter, or even potential pathogens like Vibrio spp. The presence of micro-niches within corals (Box 2) may facilitate anaerobic processes to occur, such as sulfate reduction potentially coupled to methane oxidation and methanogenesis; however, these assumed functions remain to be validated.",

Most studies report that, upon exposure to higher ocean temperature and/or acidification, there is a shift in dominance from putatively beneficial bacterial taxa, e.g., Endozoicomonas, to opportunistic and potentially pathogenic groups, such as Alteromonadaceae and Vibrionaceae. This microbial shift typically coincides with an increased prevalence of stress resistance and virulence genes and may result in elevated incidence of disease, including black band disease, yellow band disease, and dark spot syndrome, particularly when corals are exposed to multiple stressors. Furthermore, several studies have reported shifts in microbiome metabolism, such as a transition from predominantly autotrophic to heterotrophic metabolism, along with changes in secondary metabolite profiles, sulfur and nitrogen metabolism, motility and chemotaxis, and fatty acid and lipid utilization. There is also increasing support for the role of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in maintaining the stability of the coral-Symbiodiniaceae symbiosis, and thus in regulating bleaching. Elevated temperatures could increase diazotroph activity and abundance, with a resultant rise in nitrogen availability. This can be beneficial for corals since moderate levels of ammonia have been shown to increase thermal tolerance. However, as nitrogen fixation continues to increase under heat-stressed conditions, the finely tuned internal nutrient balance within the coral holobiont may shift, thereby releasing Symbiodiniaceae from its nutrient limited state and inducing phosphate starvation. This in turn could lead to reduced translocation of photosynthates to the coral host - also known as the selfish symbiont - and increased susceptibility to photodamage and subsequent bleaching.",

Compositional and functional changes in the microbiome can also be decoupled as a result of functional redundancy within the holobiont.

Furthermore, microorganisms could positively or negatively impact the long-term resilience of coral holobionts and reef ecosystems to environmental change through their rapid response to disturbances. The extensive taxonomic and metabolic diversity of the microbiome, and notably shorter generation times compared to the coral host, provide considerable potential for microorganisms to contribute to the adaptive response of the holobiont. Variation in microbial symbionts can occur via acquisition of novel microbial strains (symbiont switching), microbial community shifts (symbiont shuffling), lifestyle changes (host-associated versus free-living, mutualistic versus parasitic), horizontal gene transfers, or genetic mutations. Advantageous modifications to the microbiome could potentially be vertically transferred to subsequent coral generations, thereby increasing the overall population fitness. Importantly, however, although there is theoretical potential for the microbiome to contribute to coral acclimatization, to date there is little empirical evidence to support these ideas, and further research into the role of the microbiome in coral reef adaptation is therefore urgently needed.",

However, these meta-organisms do not occur in isolation but are nested within communities of neighboring holobionts that, in turn, interact with and influence successively larger and more complex communities and marine environments. This concept is referred to as nested ecosystems and implies that the actions of individual constituents of the coral microbiome can have effects far beyond that of the holobiont. The impacts of climate change on the coral microbiome can therefore have ramifications at the coral reef ecosystem level, including potentially transformative effects on primary production, nutrient cycling, disease ecology, and benthic community structure.",

It was first described in 1983 to represent the missing link between DOC resulting from phytoplankton primary production and its transfer to higher trophic levels within the open ocean. Heterotrophic marine microorganisms utilize DOC as an energy source and transfer carbon up the food web to flagellates and microzooplankton, which in turn are fed upon by progressively larger macroorganisms. The microbial loop has since expanded to incorporate other groups, including photosynthetic prokaryotes, mixotrophic protists, and viruses. Viruses are the most abundant organisms in global ecosystems, and evidence suggests that they represent important agents of mortality for marine microorganisms. Viral infection and lysis of microbial cells releases DOM and nutrients back into the seawater DOM pool, retaining them within the microbial food web. This process is referred to as the viral shunt and diverts microbial biomass away from higher trophic levels while strongly impacting marine nutrient cycles. Viruses also exert control on microbial community structure and diversity through \u201ckill-the-winner\u201d or \u201cpiggy-back-the-winner\u201d mechanisms. Climate change conditions are expected to influence the interactions between viruses and their hosts, with profound impacts on biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem functioning ( ). For example, viral lysis of microbial blooms in algal-dominated reefs results in amplified carbon and nutrient levels within the ecosystem, with concomitant impacts on microbial populations and viral production, leading to a positive feedback on coral disease and mortality.",

Considering these connections, predictions of the resilience of coral reef ecosystems to future ocean conditions could benefit from linking microbial community dynamics to host physiology and biogeochemical transformations. An example of an important energetic and ecological link between the coral holobiont and its surrounding environment is coral mucus. It provides a nutritious medium on which a diverse assemblage of coral-associated microbes thrive and interact with the environment via quorum sensing and the production of allelochemicals. The mucus simultaneously operates as a defensive barrier against invasive pathogenic microbes from the surrounding seawater through the production of antimicrobial compounds and the colonization of this bordering niche by resident microorganisms. Coral mucus is also continuously or periodically - depending on the coral species and mucus age - sloughed off from the coral surface into the reef environment. This represents one of the largest sources of organic matter in the coral reef ecosystem. Mucus can dissolve in seawater (dissolved organic matter, DOM) where it fuels the microbial loop (Box 3), get consumed by detritivores (see sponge loop), or sink to be degraded by sediment microbial communities, all of which result in the recycling of essential nutrients and energy back into the reef system. Coral bleaching has been shown to change the production, structure, and composition of coral mucus, which will have flow-on consequences for microbially driven nutrient cycles and food web dynamics within coral reefs.",

Depending on the abundance of their associated microorganisms, sponge species are typically classified as having high (HMA) or low (LMA) microbial abundance. The sponge microbiome is involved in autotrophic and/or heterotrophic carbon metabolism, nitrogen metabolism (e.g., the oxidation of ammonia waste from the host), sulfur cycling, storage of polyphosphate granules, and the biosynthesis of essential vitamins.

Although sponges have been thought to primarily feed on picoplankton, a number of encrusting, excavating, and massive reef sponges are also able to assimilate DOM, and this can comprise up to 90% of the holobiont's total heterotrophic carbon uptake. The DOM pool predominantly consists of coral and algal exudates and represents the largest resource of organic matter produced on reefs. A substantial fraction of the assimilated dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen (DON), and phosphorous (DOP) is subsequently released by the sponge as particulate organic matter (POM or detritus) via the rapid turnover and shedding of sponge cells or alternatively incorporated into sponge biomass. POM and biomass are in turn readily consumed by small detritivores and spongivores, respectively, who themselves are fed upon by larger animals higher in the food web. Sponges thus retain organic matter within reef ecosystems that would otherwise be lost to the open ocean and transfer the energy and nutrients stored in the DOM pool to higher trophic levels, a phenomenon referred to as the sponge loop. Both sponge cells and sponge-associated microorganisms can assimilate DOM, and it has been shown that they may utilize different fractions of the reef DOM pool depending on DOM availability, quality, and origin.",

There is also an increasing body of evidence suggesting that sponge holobionts are generally resistant to local and global stressors, including ocean warming and acidification, with some studies suggesting sponges will be potential winners under future climate scenarios. However, other studies have demonstrated shifts in the microbiome following disturbances, leading to a loss of metabolic potential and dysbiosis and eventually resulting in sponge disease and/or mortality. Changes in the sponge microbiome have been detected prior to visual signs of bleaching, whereas other studies have observed stable microbial communities until the very late stages of thermal stress when the host itself becomes necrotic. Considering this variability in sensitivity, it is apparent that the impact of climate change on sponge holobionts will be species specific, as well as dependent on the type, intensity, and duration of the disturbance. At the ecosystem level, this could result in an alternate stable state with higher abundance yet lower diversity of resistant/resilient sponges. A relative increase in sponge dominance at the expense of coral abundance would cause the benthic community to shift from being primarily dominated by photoautotrophic organisms to heterotrophic species. As this may also result in an overall loss of complexity, it is unclear if higher trophic levels can remain supported under these conditions. Considering the vital functional roles that sponge holobionts fulfill in reef ecosystems, changes in the benthic communities in response to climate change will have significant consequences for food webs and biogeochemical cycles on coral reefs.",

Elevated temperatures further stimulate microbial metabolism, and ocean acidification and hypoxia are additionally predicted to enhance nitrogen fixation while limiting nitrification, resulting in a net increase in nitrogen availability in the reef. Together with local impacts from overfishing and eutrophication, these effects can further exacerbate algal overgrowth and the positive feedback loop toward microbialization.",

On the one hand, sponges could benefit from an increased food supply in the form of algal exudates as it has been shown that algal-derived DOM is more rapidly assimilated by sponges compared with coral-derived DOM. Although stimulated nutrient retention via the sponge loop would support coral reef primary production, elevated nitrogen release to the benthos may lead to eutrophication, which would further stimulate algal overgrowth and have negative consequences for coral health. Similar to the microbial loop, labile algal-derived DOM may preferentially fuel microbial metabolism within the sponge holobiont, and this could potentially occur at the expense of the animal host. Given the complexity of microbial interactions within coral reefs, and the ongoing degradation from local and global disturbances, it is imperative that we investigate these nested microbial ecosystems in order to predict how future reefs will function.",

Since these signs often only become evident once the reef is in an advanced stage of stress and decline, sensitive and rapid markers for ecosystem stress would be highly advantageous. Microorganisms have previously been raised as potential early warning bioindicators given their rapid and often specific responses to environmental disturbances. For example, total coliform counts are typically used as a measure of fecal contamination in surface waters and drinking water supplies. To assess human impacts on coral reefs, a microbialization score has been proposed as a measure of metabolic rates of microbial communities and reef-associated fishes. Presence/absence and shifts in relative abundance of free-living or host-associated microorganisms in coral reefs could also be of high diagnostic value. Recent research has revealed that seawater microbial communities rather than host-associated microbiomes have a strong potential to reflect environmental conditions owing to their high sensitivity and predictability. However, further research is needed to establish robust baselines for microbial communities in all compartments of the reef and to elucidate their structural and functional responses to local and global stressors by incorporating microbes in long-term reef monitoring initiatives.",

Corals have been the focus of restoration practices such as coral aquaculture (\u201cgardening\u201d) or fragmentation followed by transplantation onto the reef. However, a growing appreciation for the role that microorganisms play in maintaining animal health and ecosystem functioning, together with a realization of possible implications for conservation and management of threatened species, has led some researchers to explore whether manipulation of the microbiome could be used to assist coral reef restoration. For example, natural microbiomes of healthy/stress-resistant corals, synthetic communities consisting of beneficial microorganisms for corals (BMC as probiotics) or even genetically modified bacterial strains could be used to inoculate new or diseased coral colonies in an attempt to transfer health benefits and stress resistance. Another possibility could be the development of coral stocks with enhanced stress tolerance through acceleration of coral microbiome evolutionary changes, an approach referred to as assisted evolution. It remains to be established, however, whether long-term modifications of the microbiome can be achieved, if upscaling is at all feasible and what the implications will be for the ecosystem as a whole. An alternative approach could be the identification and application of microbial cues either to increase coral larvae settlement or to avoid the growth of fouling microorganisms that would otherwise compete for space. Finally, phage therapy has been proposed to control disease progression in corals. Nonetheless, the majority of these methods are still in their infancy and require significant research and development to determine their suitability for active reef restoration efforts.",

Although microorganisms directly contribute to climate change through the production of greenhouse gases, they also offer important opportunities for remediating human-induced change. We need to understand how marine microbiomes respond and potentially adapt to climate change in order to define tolerance thresholds and identify climate-ecosystem feedbacks in coral reefs. Despite the overwhelming evidence of the fundamental role of microorganisms in climate change biology, they have rarely been the focus of climate change research thus far.

There is substantial research supporting the vital role of the microbiome in maintaining coral health and in regulating ecosystem resilience. Microorganisms are capable of buffering or exacerbating cumulative anthropogenic impacts via their role in holobiont fitness as well as by modifying nutrient and energy flows within coral reefs. Recent advances in DNA-based molecular approaches have provided unprecedented insights into the vast taxonomic and metabolic diversity of the microbial world on coral reefs, although the majority of microbial functions have merely been inferred from 16S rRNA gene analyses. In-depth functional analyses using metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, and metabolomics combined with isotopic labeling experiments and advanced microscopy methods are thus needed to validate predicted holobiont functioning and responses to environmental stress, and to determine how these relate to modified biogeochemical fluxes within the ecosystem. A holistic ecosystem microbiology approach needs to be adopted that views coral reefs as integrated systems, from genes and microbes to ecosystem-scale processes. Microbial responses to global and local stressors also need to be evaluated over different time scales, ranging from immediate physiological acclimatization to prolonged adaptive evolution. Furthermore, the incorporation of microbial monitoring in long-term coral reef monitoring projects would provide invaluable insights into microbial baselines and community dynamics in relation to biogeochemical parameters, natural anomalies, and anthropogenic disturbances. Robust predictive models should include microbial processes to interpolate and extrapolate observed microbial interactions within the coral reef environment in order to predict future reef outcomes under different disturbance regimes as well as the capacity for reef acclimatization. Finally, interdisciplinary and collaborative research is the key to successful coral reef conservation and is essential in order to guarantee a future for these unique and critical ecosystems.",
