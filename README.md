# Day 1 Progress

Today I successfully set up a simple web server using only shell commands. The page displays my name and a photo as proof of environment setup and deployment capability.

Link of the website created: http://98.70.42.23/
## Focus Areas

- Serving static HTML using the terminal
- Using shell commands to generate basic HTML content
- Starting a local web server with Python
- Verifying successful content display via a browser

# Goals

By completing this task, I practiced:

- Using shell to automate simple web tasks
- Hosting files using Pythonâ€™s built-in HTTP server
- Creating minimal HTML content using echo
- Structuring a basic self-contained static site

## Setup Notes

- Created a working directory for the web page:
  ```bash
  mkdir webpage && cd webpage
