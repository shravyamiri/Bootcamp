# Object-Oriented Design Exercises

This repository contains exercises to enhance your skills in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Python. It focuses on core OOP principles like classes, inheritance, magic methods, data classes, and static/class methods. The exercises help you understand how to design and manage classes, objects, and the relationships between them.

## Sections:
1. Classes and Objects:
   - Define a class with attributes and methods.
   - Understand class vs instance variables.
   - Learn how to initialize objects with constructors and update object states.
   - Dynamically add attributes after object creation and check types using `isinstance()`.

2. Inheritance and `super()`:
   - Learn the fundamentals of inheritance and method overriding.
   - Use `super()` to call parent class methods.
   - Understand multiple inheritance and polymorphism.
   - Use `__str__` for better string representation of objects.

3. Dunder (Magic) Methods:
   - Implement magic methods like `__str__`, `__repr__`, `__eq__`, and `__lt__`.
   - Add hashing support and indexing in custom containers.
   - Implement callable and boolean check behavior for objects.

4. Data Classes and Named Tuples:
   - Use Pythonâ€™s `@dataclass` decorator to create classes with automatic method generation.
   - Understand immutable data classes and comparison support.
   - Create custom methods in data classes and use `NamedTuple` for lightweight objects.

5. Static and Class Methods:
   - Learn the differences between static and class methods.
   - Use `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` for specialized methods in classes.
   - Understand alternative constructors and method resolution order (MRO).
   - Explore hybrid methods where static, class, and instance methods are used together.
