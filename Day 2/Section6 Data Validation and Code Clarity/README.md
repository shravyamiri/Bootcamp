Section 6: Data Validation and Code Clarity
This section focuses on writing robust, readable, and maintainable Python code using tools like dataclasses, pydantic, and logging, along with best practices for naming, structure, and documentation.

1. Data Classes and Manual Validation
Leverage the @dataclass decorator for clean, self-validating data structures:

Basic Dataclass â€“ Define simple models using Pythonâ€™s built-in dataclass.

Default Values â€“ Assign default values like country = "India".

Post-Init Validation â€“ Raise validation errors inside __post_init__.

Frozen Dataclass â€“ Make your dataclass immutable with frozen=True.

Custom Methods â€“ Add behavior such as is_adult() within the class.

Factory Defaults â€“ Use field(default_factory=list) for mutable fields.

Comparison Support â€“ Compare instances with ==.

Dataclass with Slots â€“ Use slots=True for memory optimization.

2. Validation with pydantic
Use pydantic for fast and robust runtime data validation:

Basic Model â€“ Parse data into typed models.

Validation Error â€“ Catch type mismatch issues automatically.

Nested Models â€“ Support structured JSON with inner models.

Field Constraints â€“ Add rules using conint, constr, etc.

Custom Validators â€“ Enforce rules with @validator.

Automatic Conversion â€“ Coerce values like "42" into integers.

Export Formats â€“ Serialize models to dicts and JSON.

Optional Fields â€“ Declare nullable fields with defaults.

3. Field Metadata and Readability
Improve developer experience and documentation:

Field Descriptions â€“ Add human-readable metadata using Field(...).

Field Aliases â€“ Accept keys like user_id while using id in code.

Title and Examples â€“ Enhance OpenAPI docs or tooltips.

Model Docstrings â€“ Add purpose statements directly in the class.

Editor Tooltips â€“ Metadata shows up in intelligent IDEs like VS Code.

4. Logging Best Practices
Replace print() with production-ready logging patterns:

Setup Logger â€“ Use logging.basicConfig() to initialize logging.

Logging Levels â€“ Use DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR.

Contextual Logs â€“ Inject runtime values into logs for context.

No More print() â€“ Use logging instead of print() statements.

Formatted Logs â€“ Include time, module, and severity in output.

File Output â€“ Save logs to a file for persistence.

Logger per Module â€“ Use __name__ as logger name.

Conditional Logging â€“ Enable extra logs only when debug=True.

5. Code Clarity and Naming Conventions
Adopt habits that improve maintainability and readability:

Descriptive Names â€“ Rename vague functions like do_it() to calculate_score().

Constants over Magic Numbers â€“ Use MAX_RETRIES = 3 instead of plain values.

Boolean Naming â€“ Prefix flags with is_, can_, has_.

Avoid Ambiguity â€“ Be specific instead of using generic names like temp, data.

Reduce Nesting â€“ Split deep if/for logic into helper functions.

Small Functions â€“ Limit to one task and ~10 lines.

Module Docstrings â€“ Start each file with a high-level purpose statement.

Purposeful Comments â€“ Explain why, not what.
