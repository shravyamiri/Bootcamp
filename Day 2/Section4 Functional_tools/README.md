Section 4:
Functional Tools and Utilities in Python
This repository contains Python solutions that demonstrate the use of functional programming concepts, decorators, functools utilities, and itertools essentials. The code snippets provided showcase the power of these tools to simplify programming tasks, enhance code readability, and improve performance.

1. First-Class Functions and Lambdas
- Pass Function as Argument:
Function as first-class citizens allows passing functions as arguments. We use this to apply a given function to a provided value.

- Return Function from Function:
Functions can return other functions. The make_doubler() function returns a function that doubles its input.

- Store Functions in a List:
Functions like abs, str, and hex can be stored in a list and applied to values. Example: Apply them to -42.

- Use map with Lambda:
The map() function is used along with lambda expressions to apply a function (like squaring numbers) to all elements in a list.

- Use filter with Lambda:
The filter() function is used to filter elements from a sequence based on a given condition, like filtering even numbers from a range.

- Sort with Lambda Key:
Use sorted() function along with a lambda to sort a list of tuples based on the second element.

- Inline Function Composition:
Function composition is achieved using compose(f, g) where the output of one function becomes the input of the next function.

- Closure with Lambda:
A lambda function can capture a local variable, creating closures that persist its environment.

2. Decorators
- Basic Function Decorator:
A simple decorator (simple_logger) that logs when a function starts and ends.

- Decorator with Arguments:
A decorator (prefix_printer) that accepts a string argument (prefix) and prints it before the function name.

- Timing Decorator:
A timer decorator that measures and prints the time taken by a function to execute.

- Memoization Decorator:
memoize caches the return values of a function, so if the function is called again with the same arguments, the cached result is returned.

- Debug Information Decorator:
A decorator (debug_info) that logs the name of the function, its arguments, and the return value.

- Access Control Decorator:
A decorator (role_required) that checks if a user has the required role to execute a function.

- Retry Mechanism Decorator:
A retry decorator that retries a function up to a specified number of times if it raises an exception.

- Logging Decorator with Parameters:
custom_logger decorator that accepts a log message and prints it before and after the function execution.

- Class Method Decorator:
validate_args decorator that validates the arguments passed to a class method.

- Composition of Decorators:
Combine multiple decorators like simple_logger, timer, and debug_info on a function to see the effect of chaining decorators.

3. functools Utilities
- Partial Function:
Using functools.partial() to fix the base of the int(x, base) function to base 2, creating a new function for binary conversion.

- lru_cache Memoization:
Using the @lru_cache decorator to memoize a recursive Fibonacci function for improved performance.

- Function Metadata with wraps:
Using @wraps in a decorator to preserve the function name, docstrings, and metadata when wrapping functions.

- Chained Partials:
Applying multiple partial() calls to customize a function, such as building a customized print function.

- Uncached Recursive Function:
A comparison of the performance of a recursive Fibonacci function with and without lru_cache.

- reduce with Lambda:
Using reduce and a lambda function to compute the factorial of a number.

- Default Dict Generator:
Using functools.partial() to generate nested dictionaries dynamically.

- Log Decorator with wraps:
Building a decorator with wraps that logs messages before and after the function's execution.

4. itertools Essentials
- Use count to Generate IDs:
An infinite ID generator is created using itertools.count() that generates sequential IDs starting from 1.

- Use cycle to Repeat a Pattern:
Using itertools.cycle() to cycle through a list of colors, like ["red", "green", "blue"], and repeat the pattern.

- Use repeat to Duplicate Values:
The itertools.repeat() function is used to generate a sequence of repeated values (like None for a specified number of times).

- Use chain to Flatten:
Using itertools.chain() to combine multiple iterables into one, effectively flattening the list.

- Use islice:
The itertools.islice() function is used to skip elements and take a specific number of elements from an iterable.

- Use tee:
itertools.tee() duplicates an iterator into two or more independent iterators.

- Use groupby:
Using itertools.groupby() to group a list of dictionaries by a shared key, for example grouping people by their roles.

- Use permutations and combinations:
Generate permutations and combinations of a list of elements, such as generating pairs and triples from a set [1, 2, 3].

Conclusion
This repository provides practical examples of how functional programming tools, decorators, functools, and itertools can be used effectively in Python to write clean, efficient, and readable code. These techniques are valuable for various use cases such as optimizing performance, building reusable components, and manipulating iterables.
