# Pythonic Idioms Exercises

This repository contains exercises for mastering Pythonic idioms and best practices, which will help you write clean, readable, and efficient Python code. It covers topics like EAFP vs LBYL, built-in functions, inline expressions, and context managers.

## Sections:
1. **EAFP vs LBYL:**
   - Learn the differences between "Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission" (EAFP) and "Look Before You Leap" (LBYL).
   - Explore various examples like dictionary key access, file handling, and custom object attributes using both idioms.

2. **Built-in Functions and Idioms:**
   - Practice using Pythonâ€™s built-in functions such as `enumerate()`, `zip()`, `any()`, `all()`, and more.
   - Idioms like chained comparisons, sorting with keys, and using `map()` and `filter()` effectively.

3. **Inline Expressions and Shortcuts:**
   - Learn shorthand techniques like inline conditionals (`x if condition else y`), chained assignment, and the `walrus operator`.
   - Use Python's idiomatic expressions to simplify complex logic and improve readability.

4. **Context Managers and `with`:**
   - Understand how to use the `with` statement to manage resources like files, network connections, and database locks.
   - Learn how to create custom context managers for clean resource management.
