Section 7:
1. Profiling and Timing
This part teaches how to measure performance in Python using built-in tools:

timeit and %timeit to benchmark code.

cProfile and line_profiler for identifying slow parts of code.

memory_profiler for understanding how much memory functions consume.

Manual timing using time.time() to check how long functions take.

Comparing different approaches (like list vs generator) to choose efficient ones.

2. Lazy Evaluation and Memory Efficiency
Focuses on how to write memory-efficient code:

Use generators instead of lists to handle large data.

Apply lazy techniques to filter files, load only needed data (islice, any()).

Avoid temporary lists; use generator expressions directly.

Understand how yield helps save memory by producing one item at a time.

3. Debugging Tools and Best Practices
This part explains how to debug Python code effectively:

Use debuggers like pdb or breakpoint() to pause code and inspect values.

Log information instead of printing, and format logs for clarity.

Catch and display exceptions clearly using traceback.

Use warnings for non-critical alerts.

Handle recursion or loops with debug messages for tracing.

Always log before raising exceptions.

4. Designing for Observability
Talks about writing self-monitoring code that helps in production:

Include useful context in logs (user, function name).

Track how long functions take.

Add health checks to verify the system is alive.

Track runtime metrics like counters, timers.

Use decorators to automatically log function inputs and outputs.

Monitor resource usage like CPU and memory.

5. Python Packaging with pyproject.toml
Guides how to package Python code into installable modules:

Create a pyproject.toml to define metadata and build instructions.

Set up CLI entry points for your package.

Build and install .whl or .tar.gz files locally.

Include extra files like configs or data.

Follow good versioning practices.

Ensure everything works after installing your package in a clean environment.

âœ… In Summary:
This section is about:

Making Python code faster and more efficient.

Making it easier to debug.

Making it production-ready with observability and packaging.
