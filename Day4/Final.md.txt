Final Write-Up
1. Design Decisions
In designing this system, the architectural choices revolved around modularity and scalability. The most significant architectural choice was the use of a state-based routing system (Level 6) to handle dynamic decision-making based on real-time conditions. This decision was crucial as it allowed the system to adapt to changes efficiently, ensuring flexibility in processing different types of data while keeping the system maintainable. The DAG routing approach (Level 5) provided a clear and structured flow of tasks, ensuring tasks were processed in a predetermined sequence, allowing for complex workflows to be managed with ease. This also helped streamline error recovery and task rerouting when issues occurred.

The modular structure and standardized processing (Level 2) was another key design decision. By breaking down the system into smaller, reusable components, I could easily test and scale individual modules without affecting the whole system. This abstraction allowed for simplicity and reusability while ensuring that each module's responsibility was clear.

2. Tradeoffs
While designing the system, I focused on ensuring scalability and maintainability, but there were certain tradeoffs. For instance, file recovery (Level 8) and system introspection (Level 7) required complexity, which I had to balance against performance. Some processes were simplified to avoid excessive overhead, such as omitting advanced logging mechanisms during initial development, which can later be expanded as the system scales.

One key simplification was in the Dynamic Config-Driven Pipeline (Level 3). While it is a powerful feature, I chose not to implement complex real-time configuration management at the outset, as it could have added unnecessary complexity to the initial version. The systemâ€™s limitation is the handling of dynamic or non-standard file types. Handling these in a more flexible, adaptive manner could be an enhancement for future versions.

3. Scalability
If the input size were to increase by 100x, the system would need substantial improvements to handle the load. Stream processing and state management (Level 4) would need to be enhanced to manage large, continuous data flows efficiently. I would consider partitioning the data stream into manageable chunks to distribute processing. Additionally, moving towards parallelized processing is a feasible option for scaling, particularly in file recovery and task routing.

The current system relies heavily on sequential processing in many parts of the pipeline, which would create bottlenecks under heavy load. Introducing parallel execution and optimizing data routing could address this limitation. In terms of system load, I would scale up compute resources and consider implementing a microservices architecture to distribute processing across multiple nodes.

4. Extensibility & Security
To run this system for real users, reliable error handling and robust monitoring would be essential. Real-time feedback loops on the success or failure of tasks would ensure transparency and accountability. For security, implementing a secure file upload mechanism (e.g., file hashing, virus scanning) is necessary to prevent malicious files from entering the system. User authentication and authorization would also need to be added to protect access to sensitive operations, ensuring that only authorized users can modify configurations or access output data.

Furthermore, output data should be protected by encryption both in transit and at rest, ensuring that sensitive information is not exposed. For extensibility, I would introduce additional API endpoints for integrating with external systems and facilitate easy plugin additions for new data processing tasks.
