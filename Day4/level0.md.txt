process.py – Level 0: Basic Script (No Abstraction)

Description

This is a simple, one-purpose Python script written without any functions or abstractions. It reads input line by line from standard input (stdin), strips leading and trailing whitespace from each line, converts the result to uppercase, and prints it to standard output (stdout).

This script is intentionally left unrefactored for learning purposes — it's your "before" snapshot.
